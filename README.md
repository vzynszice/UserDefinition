# User Definition
User Definition App for testing

This project was made for testing during my internship at Hyundai Assan to be used in user definition operations. N-tier architecture was used in the project, and DevExpress was used in the creation of data grids in the frontend. CRUD operations were performed in the BLL layer to be used in backend operations, and Unit of work was used here. Tables for data were created in SSMS. Access to these tables and data was performed in the DAL layer. A middleware approach was adopted for error management.
